DLC loaded in light mode; you cannot use any GUI (labeling, relabeling and standalone GUI)
Running  DLC_resnet50_5_points_tracking_cam_2Feb28shuffle1_1030000  with # of training iterations: 1030000
Running evaluation ...
Analysis is done and the results are stored (see evaluation-results) for snapshot:  snapshot-1030000
Results for 1030000  training iterations: 95 1 train error: 2.09 pixels. Test error: 16.46  pixels.
With pcutoff of 0.6  train error: 2.09 pixels. Test error: 9.76 pixels
Thereby, the errors are given by the average distances between the labels by DLC and the scorer.
Plotting...
The network is evaluated and the results are stored in the subdirectory 'evaluation_results'.
Please check the results, then choose the best model (snapshot) for prediction. You can update the config.yaml file with the appropriate index for the 'snapshotindex'.
Use the function 'analyze_video' to make predictions on new videos.
Otherwise, consider adding more labeled-data and retraining the network (see DeepLabCut workflow Fig 2, Nath 2019)
